# Transformer â€“ English to Spanish Translator
#### Spencer Karofsky

### High-Level Description

I am very enthusiastic about AI/ML, and after several years of AI projects, I wanted to embark a new challenge: training a transformer.

I implemented and trained a transformer for English-to-Spanish Machine Translation based on my understanding of the 'Attention is All You Need' paper.

### Features

* Uses the [OPUS Books](https://opus.nlpl.eu/opus-100.php) dataset
* Trains a transformer based on [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762)
* Runs inference on nine English example sentences, increasing in sentence complexity
